# Secrets 
This program is based on Spring 6, Spring Boot 3, Spring Security 6, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap 5.3.2, JQuery 3.7.1, MySQL 8 and Java 17.

A role concept has also been implemented that allows a user to be assigned several roles.

Important to know is, that at least each user must have the USER-role.


In addition, a database-based I18N localisation with two languages (German & English) was implemented.

The program can therefore serve as a starting point for your own secure applications.

The development was inspired by the work of the following people and companies with published examples:
